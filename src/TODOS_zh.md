web pages(HTML, CSS), program source codes(Python, Ruby, Perl, etc.), structured texts (Markdown, Textile, TeX, etc.),
or any other kind of plain-text.

Just For Mac

The application is exactly made for macOS. CotEditor looks and behaves just as macOS applications should. It means, you already know how to use it even on the

You can also easily write your own macro in your favorite languages.
