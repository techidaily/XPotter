### [CotEditor](https://github.com/lauer3912/CotEditor)

CotEditor is a light-weight,neat,yet powerful text editor designed for editing plain-text files such as
web pages(HTML, CSS), program source codes(Python, Ruby, Perl, etc.), structured texts (Markdown, Textile, TeX, etc.),
or any other kind of plain-text.

Just For Mac

The application is exactly made for macOS. CotEditor looks and behaves just as macOS applications should. It means, you already know how to use it even on the
first launch. There are no complex configuration files that require geek knowledge so that you can access all your settings including syntax definitions and themes from a standard preference window.

It's fully customizable. There are, of course, syntax highlight feature for various languages, find and replace with the regular expression, auto-indentation, command-line tool, and lots of other deep functions. You can also easily write your own macro in your favorite languages.
