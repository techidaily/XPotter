The XPotter project is an attempt to build a high quality tool platform, using modern software engineering techniques. It is initially built for macOS, using Cocoa for the user interface. 



## Goals include:

- **Incredibly high performance.** All operations should commit and paint in under 16ms. The editor should never make you wait for anything.

- **Reliability.** Crashing, hanging, or losing work should never happen.


- **Developer friendliness.**
