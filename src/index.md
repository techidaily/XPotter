## Goals include:

- **Incredibly high performance.** All operations should commit and paint in under 16ms. The editor should never make you wait for anything.

- **Reliability.** Crashing, hanging, or losing work should never happen.

- **Normal user and developer friendliness.**

- **More tools**
